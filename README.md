# My Awesome Project
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This a web app created with the NASA Picture of the Day api to fetch data that shows users the certain photo of the day as well as the information that NASA used to describe the photo.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I am going to update it soon to use async/await to get fetch the api data as well as display the date chosen on the page.

## Lessons Learned:

I loved doing this app because it allows me to create something bigger than just a local photo site. I am now able to get a vast amount of data from api's to basically do whatever I want with my apps!

ENJOY! :)
